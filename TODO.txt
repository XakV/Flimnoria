# Pre-Existing TODO stuff
- fix ext and fasinfo to report whether a Fedora Talk extension is enabled or
  disabled (not currently possible, the config setting is only readable by
  that user, not anybody)
- function to query the last time the cache was refreshed

## New TODO stuff
- Fedora's Zodbot lives on value1 in prod, these packages are also installed
  - supybot-koji
  - supybot-notify
  - supybot-pinglists
  - supybot-fedmsg
  - packagedb-cli
  - python-simplejson
- I think that means that we need to look at these other plugins as well
  to make sure they are updated to python 3?

- I'm getting this error that I need to look at more
- Happens after supybot as logged in to fas and downloaded stuff

File "/home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/fedmsg/config.py", line 609, in load_config
    raise ValueError("No config value 'endpoints' found.")
ValueError: No config value 'endpoints' found.

- this looks like something with fedmsg that needs attention
